# Clone the repo

## Javascript

To get started as fast as possible we're going to clone the example git repo that we have setup that can be found at: [https://github.com/lumiastream/lumiastream-socket-demo-js](https://github.com/lumiastream/lumiastream-socket-demo-js)

We will head to our terminal and we will enter:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lumiastream/lumiastream-socket-demo-js
```

Now we will `cd` into the directory with:

```bash
cd lumiastream-socket-demo-js
```

and run:

```bash
npm install
```

After this open up the main.js file in your favorite editor and edit line 3 by pasting in the token that we received in the **Get a token page**

Now let's run the script from the terminal with:

```bash
npm run start
```

This sample repo will first send a twitch-follower alert to demonstrate that it can also send the same rest commands through Websockets and then it will stay on to listen to events that are coming in through Lumia Stream.
