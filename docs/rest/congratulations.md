# Congratulations!

You have just learned the **basics of the REST API** we're interested in seeing what you can make with this and excited to hear your feedback

Lumia Stream has **much more to offer**!

Check out our Websockets also where you'll have the ability to send any of the REST api commands mentioned above, but also the ability to listen to events that happen within Lumia. Take a look at **[Websockets](../websockets/clone-the-repo.md)** to get started

Anything **unclear** or **buggy** in this tutorial? [Please report it!](https://forum.lumiastream.com/dev)
